# Week 1 - Workshop 1
Introduction to Python and version control using Git. If you've made it here, we hope you've been able to fork the parent repo and clone a local copy of the forked repo. We will now help you get started with Python! To do so, we ask you to follow the following steps. These will set you up your computer to run Python, either locally or directly on the cloud. By following the steps for both options you will always be able to run your scripts both online and offline.

# Anaconda Basics
Anaconda is a popular distribution of the Python programming language, designed for data science and scientific computing. It provides a comprehensive package management system that makes it easy to install, manage, and switch between different Python libraries and environments. Anaconda comes with a collection of pre-installed libraries and tools commonly used in data science, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.

To use Anaconda, you first need to download and install it on your computer. Anaconda is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms, and you can download the installer from the official Anaconda website (<https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>). Once installed, you can access Anaconda through the Anaconda Navigator graphical user interface or via the command line.

Anaconda Navigator provides a user-friendly interface for managing environments, packages, and applications. You can create new Python environments with specific versions of Python and customized packages. These environments allow you to isolate and manage different projects with their own dependencies. In the Navigator, you can also launch Jupyter Notebook, an interactive web-based environment for running Python code, creating data visualizations, and documenting your work.

Alternatively, you can use Anaconda through the command line by utilizing the conda command. conda is a package and environment management system that comes bundled with Anaconda. With conda, you can create, activate, and manage environments, as well as install, update, and remove packages. The command line interface offers greater flexibility and control, especially when working with multiple environments or automating tasks through scripts.

Overall, Anaconda simplifies the process of setting up a Python environment for data science by providing a comprehensive distribution, package management system, and environment management tools. It is widely used in the data science community due to its ease of use and the extensive collection of pre-installed libraries. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data scientist, Anaconda can greatly enhance your Python development workflow by streamlining package installation, managing dependencies, and isolating project environments.

Steps to follow:
* Install Anaconda: Start by downloading and installing Anaconda, a popular distribution of Python that comes bundled with many useful libraries and tools for data science and scientific computing. Anaconda is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Visit the official Anaconda website (<https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>) and download the installer appropriate for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to set up Anaconda on your machine.

* Launch Anaconda Navigator: After installing Anaconda, you can access its graphical user interface (GUI) called Anaconda Navigator. Launch Anaconda Navigator, which provides an easy-to-use interface for managing environments, installing packages, and launching applications like Jupyter Notebook.

* Create a New Environment: In Anaconda Navigator, you can create a new Python environment to isolate your projects and manage dependencies. Click on the "Environments" tab, then click the "Create" button to create a new environment. Specify the Python version and desired packages for your project.

* Launch Jupyter Notebook: Once your environment is created, go to the "Home" tab in Anaconda Navigator. Find your newly created environment and click the "Launch" button to start Jupyter Notebook. This will open a new browser window with the Jupyter interface.
