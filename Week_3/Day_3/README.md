## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining as much information as possible. It accomplishes this by identifying the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables that capture the maximum variance in the data.

Here's a step-by-step overview of the PCA process:

Step 1: Data Standardization:
If the variables in the dataset have different scales or units, it is advisable to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This ensures that all variables contribute equally to the PCA.

Step 2: Covariance Matrix Calculation:
Next, the covariance matrix is calculated based on the standardized data. The covariance matrix provides information about the relationships between pairs of variables in the dataset. It quantifies how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable.

Step 3: Eigenvector-Eigenvalue Decomposition:
The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are computed. The eigenvectors represent the directions or axes of maximum variance in the data, while the eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector. The eigenvectors are also referred to as the principal components.

Step 4: Selection of Principal Components:
The principal components are ranked in descending order of their corresponding eigenvalues. The eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component. Typically, the first few principal components with the highest eigenvalues are selected for further analysis, as they capture the majority of the variance in the data.

Step 5: Dimensionality Reduction:
The original dataset is transformed by projecting it onto the selected principal components. This reduces the dimensionality of the data, as the transformed dataset consists of a smaller number of variables (principal components) that explain most of the variance in the original dataset.

Step 6: Interpretation and Analysis:
The transformed dataset can be used for visualization, clustering, classification, or other analyses. The principal components can be interpreted to understand the underlying structure or patterns in the data. The first principal component captures the maximum variance and is often associated with the most significant features or patterns in the dataset. Subsequent principal components capture decreasing amounts of variance but may represent more specific patterns or variations.



## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used for feature extraction and classification tasks. It aims to find a linear combination of features that maximizes the separation between different classes while minimizing the variation within each class. LDA is commonly used in machine learning, pattern recognition, and data analysis.

Here's a step-by-step overview of the Linear Discriminant Analysis process:

Step 1: Data Preparation:
Start by organizing your data into a matrix where each row represents an observation or data point, and each column represents a feature or variable.

Step 2: Compute Class Statistics:
Calculate the class means for each feature by taking the average value of each feature for each class. Additionally, compute the overall mean vector, which represents the average feature values across all classes.

Step 3: Compute Scatter Matrices:
Calculate the scatter matrices, which quantify the variation within and between the classes. The scatter matrices used in LDA are the within-class scatter matrix (Sw) and the between-class scatter matrix (Sb).

- Within-class scatter matrix (Sw): This matrix measures the spread of the data within each class. It is computed by summing the individual scatter matrices for each class, where each scatter matrix represents the variation of the data within a particular class.
- Between-class scatter matrix (Sb): This matrix quantifies the differences between the class means. It is computed by summing the outer products of the difference between each class mean and the overall mean vector.

Step 4: Compute Fisher's Linear Discriminants:
The goal of LDA is to find a linear projection that maximizes the separation between classes while minimizing the within-class variation. This is achieved by computing Fisher's Linear Discriminants, which are the eigenvectors of the generalized eigenvalue problem:

$S_w^{-1}S_b\mathbf{w} = \lambda\mathbf{w}$

where:
- $S_w^{-1}$ is the inverse of the within-class scatter matrix.
- $S_b$ is the between-class scatter matrix.
- $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector or the direction of the linear projection.
- $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue associated with the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$.

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated, and the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are retained.

Step 5: Dimensionality Reduction and Classification:
The retained eigenvectors, known as discriminant axes, are used to transform the original feature space into a lower-dimensional feature space. The number of retained discriminant axes is typically less than the original number of features, reducing the dimensionality of the data.
