# Machine Learning in Materials Science

In this last lecture, we will take data handling and model creation one step further and look in to machine learning techniques. The content is adapted from the paper [Machine Learning for Materials Scientists: An Introductory Guide toward Best Practices](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c01907). The tutorials are based on the supplementary information from [Machine Learning for Materials Scientists: An Introductory Guide toward Best Practices](https://github.com/anthony-wang/BestPractices).
