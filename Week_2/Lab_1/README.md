## Task 1: 
The following factorial (Example 6-2 in the text) was used to investigate the effects of four factors on the filtration rate of a resin for a chemical process plant. The factors are A = temperature, B = pressure, C = mole ratio (concentration of chemical formaldehyde), D = stirring rate. This experiment was performed in a pilot plant.

The parameter ranges are:
- A: 20-40 C 
- B: 1-1.2 bar
- C: 0.3-0.6 %
- D: 1000-1300 rpm  


Make a factorial design and make a model with as few contrasts as possible form the data in [Ex6-2.csv](/Week_2/Lab_1/Task_1/Ex6-2.csv). If applicable, perform an analysis of the performance of the model. 


## Task 2: Optimization 
Find the maximum for the Gaussian function given in the jupyter notebook [opt.ipynb](/Week_2/Lab_1/Task_2/opt.ipynb)... This task is not related to Task 1. Implement a factorial design and create a model to find the maximum.
