## Task 1: 
Lets look at the data in in [data_example.xlsx](/Week_2/Workshop_4/data_example.xlsx). Download it and open the file in excel. HAve a look at the following video in which Minitab is used to create a factorial design of experiments and to perform the analysis of the results: 

[Minitab tutorial - Full Factiorial Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Epk5de8MQ) (Link will take you to youtube...)


Can we do the same in Python? Let's try... Go through the [jupyter notebook](/Week_2/Workshop_4/Jupyter-notebooks/DoE-2factor_full.ipynb) and see if you can follow what has been done. Write comments and explanations in the notebook. 

## Task 2: Let's create the full 2$^6$ factorial design described in Box and Norman. 
Let's have a look at a more [complicated case](/Week_2/Workshop_4/Jupyter-notebooks/2-6factor.ipynb). Go through the notebook and se if you understand the steps. Write comments and explanations in the notebook.
