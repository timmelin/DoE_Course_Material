# Workshop 5

## Task 1: [Reduction of model and more analysis of the 2$^6$ factor problem](/Week_2/Workshop_5/Jupyter-notebooks/2-6factor-more_analysis.ipynb)
Let's do some more analysis of the model from Task 2. We follow the procedure as outlined in chapter 4.3 and onwards in the course book. Go through the notebook together with the course book and see if you can follow what is done.  
 
## Task 2: [Fractional design of 2$^6$ factor problem](/Week_2/Workshop_5/Jupyter-notebooks/fractional_design.ipynb)
In this excercise, we will look at ways to reduce the model by removing interactions and the concequences of these actions.
