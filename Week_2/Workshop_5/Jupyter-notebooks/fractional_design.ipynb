    "The prior section showed an example of what an experimental design might like look like for 6 variables. However, this resulted in a  26=64\n",
    "  experiment design campaign. This is potentially a major issue - if my experiments take 6 hours, and have to be staggered over working hours on weekdays, you're looking at almost 90 days turnaround time, assuming each experiment is carried out flawlessly. This is simply not a realistic view of experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we saw that a three-coefficient model captured nearly as much detail as a 64-coefficient model. By reducing the number of input variables we looked at, we turned certain experiments into replicates (because the only thing changed bewteen them were insignificant variables or variable combinations).\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can halve or quarter our effort, and substantially improve our effectiveness in the lab, by carefully selecting experiments at each stage of the experiment to reveal a maximum amount of information, and avoiding as much as possible these kinds of duplicate experiments, through a fractional factorial design."
