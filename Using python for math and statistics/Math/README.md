# Math basics for Material Chemists

This folder contains a series of notebooks demonstrating how to use python to solve mathematical probles encountered in chemistry. The examples follows the the book Mathermatical [Methods for Molecular Sciences: Theory and Applications, Visualizations and Narrative by John E. Strauss (ISBN 978-1-940380-13-1)](http://sites.bu.edu/straub/mathematical-methods-for-molecular-science/). Most examples are collected and adapted from CHEM 1000 - Spring 2023 Prof. Geoffrey Hutchison, University of Pittsburgh.
